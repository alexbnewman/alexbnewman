### Hi there! I'm Alex. 👋

I am a student at the University of Michigan graduating in May 2025, with a double major in computer science and sociology. 

I am particularly interested in full-stack development, and was most recently employed as a web developer for U-M's College of Engineering. I was also recently a lead developer for a UMich student organization, Void Tech. I managed a team of six developers, and our organization worked to assist and solve issues for the U-M student community. 

I am currently Chief of Information for the wellness app "Youphoria", where I handle backend development.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I love to rock climb 🧗, snowboard 🏂, read 📚, and discover new places (cafés, museums, libraries, etc.!) to camp out with my laptop 💻.
