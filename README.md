### Hi there! I'm Alex. 👋

I am a recent graduate (September 2025) from the University of Michigan, with a double major in computer science and sociology. 

I am especially interested in full-stack development and currently serve as a Tech Fellow at CodePath, where I help underserved students master full-stack concepts. I also work as a software engineer for Ballet & Books, a nonprofit that advances educational equity by combining early literacy instruction with creative movement. There, I'm building core AWS features—including authentication, role-based views, and cloud data storage -- as well as a Next.js/TypeScript frontend to support volunteers, administrators, and program participants.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I love to rock climb 🧗, snowboard 🏂, read 📚, and discover new places (cafés, museums, libraries, etc.!) to camp out with my laptop 💻.
