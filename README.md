### Hi there! I'm Alex. 👋

I am a student at the University of Michigan (graduating in May of 2025), double majoring in computer science and sociology. I am particularly interested in full-stack development, and was most recently employed as a web developer for U-M's College of Engineering.

I am currently working as lead developer for a UMich student organization called Void Tech. I manage a team of six developers, and our organization works to assist and solve issues for the U-M student community.

I love to rock climb 🧗, snowboard 🏂, read 📚, and discover new places (cafés, museums, libraries, etc.!) to camp out with my laptop 💻.
