### Hi there! I'm Alex. 👋

I am a student at the University of Michigan graduating in June 2025, with a double major in computer science and sociology. 

I am especially interested in full-stack development and currently serve as a Tech Fellow at CodePath, where I help underserved students master intermediate full-stack concepts. I am also a lead developer for a startup, Concord Systems Corp., managing a team of twelve. There, I've worked on both an OTC client/admin platform, built with React.js and Flask, as well as R&D for crypto strategy profitability analysis.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I love to rock climb 🧗, snowboard 🏂, read 📚, and discover new places (cafés, museums, libraries, etc.!) to camp out with my laptop 💻.
